# Ethereum Voucher Scaling

## Intention
This project represents a tool that allows a scalable solution for web3 communities to create ETH vouchers and distribute them to their users.

This tool streamlines the process of committing vouchers, verifying the recipient's response and sending the voucher amounts in an efficient way.

It is specifically designed to support large scale voucher usage, e.g. for projects that want to promote user engagement and provide and incentive for such.

## Workflow
In such scenario, users that the protocol deems worthy of receiving an ETH voucher would receive two codes:

- an on-chain generated code
- an off-chain generated code (generated by the backend)

The users receive both codes and can then provide those to the provided user page on the front-end. The frontend evaluates the codes and if successful the pledger will receive a notification that the user has provided a valid combination and as such the voucher can be sent.

The off-chain code component in this sense serves as a safety mechanism so that sophisticated blockchain users will not be able to just read the voucher codes and act as if they were the original recipients of those vouchers.

## Features

- create arbitrary amount of vouchers
- automated voucher creation, verification and sending
- tracking of available balances and vouchers
- delegate operations to trusted voucher operator
- simple front-end and back-end (simulation)
